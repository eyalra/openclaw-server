### Buying committee
| Role | Cares about | Our pitch angle |
|---|---|---|
| CFO / VP Finance | DSO reduction, bad debt, cash flow visibility | "Cut DSO by 30%, automate credit decisions, reduce write-offs" |
| Controller / AR Manager | Daily pain of chasing invoices, manual reconciliation | "Stop chasing payments. Automate the entire AR workflow." |
| Head of Sales / CRO | Offering terms to win deals, but worried about risk | "Offer net terms to every buyer without taking on credit risk" |
| Head of Digital / IT | Integration with ERP, platform modernization | "API-first, integrates with your ERP and ecommerce stack" |

## Secondary ICP: B2B Marketplaces & Platforms

### Profile
- B2B marketplaces, procurement platforms, vertical SaaS with payments
- Need to offer net terms / trade credit to their sellers' buyers
- Examples: industry-specific Amazons, procurement tools, vertical commerce platforms

### Why they need Balance
- Their buyers expect net-30/60/90 terms (it's how B2B works)
- Building credit/AR infrastructure in-house is expensive and slow
- Balance embeds as infrastructure — white-label net terms inside their platform

### Key contacts
- Head of Payments / Fintech
- VP Product
- CEO / COO (smaller platforms)
- Partnerships / BD lead
