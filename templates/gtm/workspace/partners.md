## Partner playbook

### How to engage a new platform partner
1. Research the platform: who are their sellers/buyers, do they offer payment terms today?
2. Identify the payments or fintech lead
3. Lead with their pain: "Your buyers expect net terms. Building it in-house takes 12+ months."
4. Propose a pilot: embed Balance for a subset of transactions
5. Show the economics: take rate, conversion lift, reduced churn
