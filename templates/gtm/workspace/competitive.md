## Direct competitors (Net Terms / AR Automation)

### Resolve (formerly PaySimply)
- **What they do:** B2B net terms and AR automation
- **Strengths:** Strong brand, good marketing, VC-backed
- **Weaknesses:** <!-- fill in from deal experience -->
- **When we see them:** <!-- which deal types -->
- **Our angle:** <!-- how we win against them -->

### Billtrust
- **What they do:** AR automation, e-invoicing, payments
- **Strengths:** Enterprise installed base, long track record
- **Weaknesses:** Legacy tech, slow to innovate, complex implementation
- **When we see them:** Enterprise deals, especially manufacturing/distribution
- **Our angle:** Modern API-first approach vs. their legacy on-prem heritage

### Credit Key
- **What they do:** B2B BNPL / financing at checkout
- **Strengths:** Simple checkout integration
- **Weaknesses:** Limited to point-of-sale, not full AR workflow
- **When we see them:** Ecommerce-first B2B companies
- **Our angle:** We do the full AR lifecycle, not just checkout financing

## Adjacent / "do nothing" competitors

### Manual processes (spreadsheets + QuickBooks)
- **Reality:** This is our #1 competitor. Most prospects are doing it manually.
- **Our angle:** Quantify the cost: FTE time on collections, DSO impact, bad debt write-offs, missed sales from not offering terms.

### ERP modules (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite AR)
- **Reality:** They have AR modules but they're basic — no credit decisioning, no automated collections, no buyer portal.
- **Our angle:** We complement the ERP, not replace it. We plug into their system and automate what the ERP can't.

### Banks / factoring companies
- **Reality:** Some companies factor their receivables or use bank credit lines.
- **Our angle:** Factoring is expensive (2-5% per invoice) and the buyer experience is terrible. Balance gives you control.
