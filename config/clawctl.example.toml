# --- Users ---
# Add one [[users]] block per team member.
# Secret values are stored in separate files under build/secrets/<name>/
# The secret names below refer to filenames, not the actual values.
#
# Secrets are flexible — declare whichever API keys your provider needs.
# Each key becomes an env var inside the container (uppercased).
# Examples:
#   openrouter_api_key = "openrouter_api_key"  → OPENROUTER_API_KEY
#   anthropic_api_key  = "anthropic_api_key"   → ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
